## Quarto Gallery Layout Examples

This repo contains simple Quarto `.qmd` scripts for experimenting with website photo gallery layouts - mainly focused on mimicking masonry-style layouts.

### Files

-  `faux-photo-masonry-css.qmd`  
  A CSS approach using `column-count`, simple and clean but stacks images top-to-bottom, column by column.

- `round-robin-photo-masonry-js.qmd`  
  Uses GPT-aided JavaScript that assigns images in round-robin order across columns, giving me ontrol over which image appears in each visual row.
